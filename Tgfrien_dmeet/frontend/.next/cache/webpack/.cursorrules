You are an expert in HTML5 prototyping and UI/UX simulation. Your task is to build a functional and design-accurate front-end demo of **MysticTalk**, a Telegram-integrated anonymous social app, using the simplest and most error-resistant HTML5, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. You should use **fake/mock data** for all API calls, and simulate real app behaviors visually.

## Goals
- Create a clean front-end demo for MysticTalk
- Mock all backend data; the goal is to simulate UI/UX only
- Use responsive layout with modern iOS-style design
- Prioritize Telegram UI design principles
- Make sure the app feels native-like, sleek, intuitive

## Visual & Interaction Design Rules
- Follow **Telegram UI Design Guidelines** as primary standard
- Refer to **iOS Human Interface Guidelines** for structure, spacing, and navigation
- Use large, readable fonts, clean spacing, and minimalistic controls
- Use emojis or icons where appropriate for engagement
- Each step in a flow (like registration or MBTI test) should explain why it’s being asked, with motivational text

## Structure Overview
Build the following screens and navigation mockups using HTML/CSS:

### 1. Home Screen
- Navigation tabs: Home, Chat, Tasks, Profile
- Main feature button: 🎲 Random Match (dice icon)
- Below: Recently matched users with “Say Hi” and “Send Gift” buttons

### 2. Chat Page
- List of users previously chatted with
- Status tag if mutual friend
- If not friend, button to “Request to chat”
- Message area with text input and coin indicator (each message costs 1 coin unless mutual)

### 3. Gift Overlay
- Triggered from “Send Gift” button
- List gifts:
  - 🌹 Single Flower (10 coins)
  - 💐 Bouquet (30 coins)
  - 🎂 Cake (50 coins)
  - 🍾 Champagne (100 coins)
  - 🎁 Premium Box (150 coins)
  - 🚗 Sports Car (300 coins)
- Display coin deduction when gift selected

### 4. Profile Page
- Avatar, nickname, MBTI, Zodiac, Chinese Zodiac, Coin Balance
- “Edit Profile” button to trigger info editing

### 5. Edit Profile Flow (Step-by-step)
- Gender selection
- Seeking preference: Male / Female / Any
- Height selector (5cm per level)
- Weight selector (10kg per level)
- Ethnicity (preset list)
- Eye color (preset list)
- Interest tags (choose up to 10 from mock list)
- Relationship goals: Chatting, Deep talk, Casual, Long-term, Marriage, Not sure
- All steps show reason: “Help us find better matches!”

### 6. MBTI Test (Multi-step form)
- 16 questions across EI, SN, TF, JP
- Each with 4 choices, scored [2, 1, -1, -2]
- Show progress bar and motivational header
- At the end, show type result and share link

### 7. Task Page
- List only **incomplete** tasks
- Red dot indicator in navigation if any are incomplete
- Simulate login streak reward (10-day cycle) as popup
- Task examples: Invite friends, Follow Telegram channel

### 8. Invite Screen
- Copy invite link
- Simulate “Choose Telegram friend to invite” button

## Interaction Notes
- All actions (e.g. sending message, gift, starting test) just visually simulate success/failure
- Use mock data only (local JS objects or JSON files)
- You may use minimal vanilla JS or a lightweight UI framework (like Alpine.js)
- Avoid all backend logic or real API hooks

## Output Expectations
- Full HTML/CSS files with working navigation & transitions
- Mobile-first layout, styled for iPhone 14 look and feel
- Include icon placeholders where needed
- Use realistic mock data for avatars, names, MBTI types
- Host images locally or use placeholder services (e.g. unsplash, placeholder.com)
- Use class names and structure clearly for easy conversion to real app in future

## Naming & Assets
- Project name: MysticTalk
- All branding, headings, meta titles use “MysticTalk”
- Icons for Chat, Tasks, Gift, Zodiac, etc. should be consistent and reused

Remember: this is not a production app, it’s a design-prototype front-end for demo and usability testing only. Keep the code clean and focused on simulation and style.
